# DVLD Management System
An educational desktop application that simulates core operations of a Driver & Vehicle Licensing Department (DVLD), built using **C#**, **WinForms**, and **SQL Server**, following a clean **3-Layer Architecture** (UI – Business – Data Access).
This project was developed as part of my programming foundations learning journey, with a strong focus on **architecture**, **data handling**, and **real-world domain modeling** rather than just UI implementation.

## Project Purpose
This project is not a production system. It is an educational and practical application designed to:
* Apply programming fundamentals in a realistic system
* Practice layered architecture and separation of concerns
* Translate real-world business rules into code
* Build a strong foundation for future work in software and data-related fields

## Project Overview
The DVLD Management System simulates the core operations of a driver licensing authority, including managing people, drivers, licenses, tests, and application workflows. The focus of this project is:
* Clean architecture
* Separation of concerns
* Maintainable and readable code
* Practical use of databases in desktop applications

## Architecture
The project follows a 3-Layer Architecture:
* **UI Layer (WinForms)** (Handles user interaction, forms, and navigation)
* **Business Layer** (Contains application logic, validations, and rules)
* **Data Access Layer (DAL)** (Responsible for all database operations using SQL Server.)

This structure improves:
* Maintainability
* Scalability
* Testability
* Code clarity

## Main Features 
* User authentication & login
* People management
* Driver management
* License issuing and renewal
* Test scheduling and results
* Application status tracking
* Separation between UI, logic, and data access

## Technologies Used
* C#
* WinForms
* .NET
* SQL Server
* ADO.NET
* 3-Layer Architecture
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I practiced and applied:
* Real-world desktop application structure
* Layered architecture design
* Database-driven application development
* Clean separation of responsibilities
* Git & GitHub workflow using Visual Studio
